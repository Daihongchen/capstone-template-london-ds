# Checklist 

This document gives a general guide of how to set up a capstone/portfolio project.
This guide is by no means definitive, but if you follow all the check points, you should be able to create a quality project here.
Feel free to copy this document into your actual repo and then X off each as you do it so you can have this project split into many small, actionable commits. 
Though this list of things will be very long and might seem daunting to complete all, these are all things that go into a complete data project. 

Each second level header can be thought of a a small stage for your capstone project.
You can go out of order if you'd like, but it might make sense to try to keep it linear before going more complex... (sounds familiar...) 

Note that you can make both complete and non-complete checkmarks within markdown like the example here.

* [X] Read the above paragraph
* [ ] Copy this document to your github repo project

## Setting Things Up 

* [ ] Start a new github repo page for your capstone
* [ ] Make sure the project has a clear name  
* [ ] Initialize with a README 
* [ ] Set project as public, not private 
* [ ] Share your github link with the instructor in charge of your capstone  
* [ ] Copy this checklist into your new project repo   
* [ ] Check off some of these boxes you have completed like the example above 
* [ ] Copy the Boilerplate README to your new repo
* [ ] Push this repo with your first commit message!  

## Setting Your Large Goals 

It's important to start with the ends in mind for any large scale project.
This does not mean that you want a specific result, but rather you know an exact question that you are pursuing at first.
It is OK for this to change here or there, just make sure you document it.

* [ ] Remove the top level instructional header of the boilerplate README 
* [ ] Fill in the boiler plate README with your current goals 
* [ ] Leave blank any areas where you are not sure

## Setting Up Your Github Repo

After getting a general idea of the project and where you initially plan for it to go, now you can start thinking about what you're going to do.
At this point, we suggest doing a few small things just to avoid a headache later.
